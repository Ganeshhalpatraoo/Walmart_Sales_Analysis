# Walmart Sales Analysis

This project analyzes Walmart's sales data to identify trends and patterns in product performance, sales fluctuations, and customer behavior. The dataset includes weekly sales data from various Walmart stores, segmented by department, location, and other attributes. The goal is to uncover insights to help Walmart optimize its sales strategies, improve inventory management, and enhance customer experience.

## Project Overview

The analysis covers the following key areas:
- **Sales by Department**: Breakdown of sales performance across different departments.
- **Sales Trends**: Fluctuations in weekly sales, with a focus on seasonality.
- **Store Performance**: Comparison of sales across different Walmart stores.
- **Promotions**: Impact of promotional events on sales performance.
- **Weather Effects**: Analyzing the correlation between weather and sales.

## Libraries Used
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations and handling missing values.
- **Matplotlib**: For generating visualizations like line charts and bar charts.
- **Seaborn**: For creating more advanced visualizations and statistical plots.
- **datetime**: For handling time-based data.

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains the following columns:
- **date**: The date of the sales transaction.
- **store**: The store where the sales occurred.
- **department**: The department where the item was sold.
- **weekly_sales**: The total sales for the week.
- **holiday_flag**: Whether the week included a holiday or not.
- **temperature**: The average temperature for the week.
- **fuel_price**: The average price of fuel during the week.
- **unemployment**: The unemployment rate during the week.

## Key Findings

1. **Sales by Department**:
   - Certain departments (e.g., grocery, electronics) consistently outperform others in terms of weekly sales, providing insight into product demand.

2. **Sales Trends**:
   - Weekly sales show a strong seasonal pattern, with sales spiking during certain holidays and events, indicating opportunities for targeted promotions.

3. **Store Performance**:
   - Comparison across stores reveals significant variation in sales, likely due to differences in location, customer base, or inventory management.

4. **Promotions**:
   - Promotional events lead to a notable increase in sales, but the impact varies across departments and stores. Timing and product relevance are key factors in success.

5. **Weather Effects**:
   - There is a slight correlation between weather conditions (such as temperature) and sales, suggesting that external factors can influence purchasing behavior.

## Visualizations

The project includes a variety of visualizations:
- **Line Charts**: To visualize weekly sales trends over time.
- **Bar Charts**: For comparing sales by department and store.
- **Heatmaps**: To illustrate correlations between weather, promotions, and sales.
- **Box Plots**: To highlight sales performance distribution by department and store.
